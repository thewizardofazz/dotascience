    "## Purpose\n",
    "My purpose in creating this project was to practice my newly acquired proficiency in the Python language, along with a few very common data science packages for the language. I chose to complete my first data analysis for a video game I have been in love with for the past 5 years, DOTA 2. DOTA 2 is categorized as a MOBA and is played on a computer. The game has over 10 million monthly players across the globe and has garnered a large viewership for its competitive events. Every August *The International* (DOTA 2's World Championships) is held with the 18 best teams in the world competing for a large prize pool. For the past five internationals the prize pool of the tournament has been crowd-funded, meaning that the player base contributes to the prize pool by purchasing in-game cosmetic items. The prize pool for this years International, TI8, was over $25 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this analysis I performed get requests on the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com/) to access a multitude of data points related to the game. I performed this analysis across all 195 games of TI8, including both the tournament's group stage and main event LAN tournament, however I did not look at data from the qualifiers. This write-up assumes a surface level understanding of the game. If you would like to learn a little bit more about the game and have two minutes to spend, check out [This is DOTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp8neRiF9-k) published by the game's developer Valve Software. I hope you enjoy"

This process included a couple more manipulations because the *Longest Game* and *Shortest Game* statistics were referenced in number of seconds because all indexes of a NumPy array are required to have the same data type (in this case float). I removed those columns from the DataFrame once it was created and then converted them to a timedelta64 datatype and added them back to the DataFrame. There was also a weird issue where *Optic Gaming* was being referenced as an empty string from the API, so I manually changed it."
